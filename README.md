• An AQI time-series prediction model using stacked LSTM on 380K+ records of pollutant data with 30-day sliding windows. 
• Performed EDA, handled missing values, applied MinMax scaling, and achieved optimized performance evaluated using            
MSE/RMSE metrics. 
• Built and deployed an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time AQI forecasting.
